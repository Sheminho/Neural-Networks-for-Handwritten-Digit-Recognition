# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Neural Networks

## Overview
This project implements a neural network model to classify handwritten digits (0-9) using the MNIST dataset.  
Originally, the model was trained for binary classification (0/1), and later upgraded to multi-class classification.

## Features
- Neural Network trained on MNIST dataset.
- Softmax activation for multi-class output.
- Cross-Entropy loss for classification.
- FastAPI deployment for real-time predictions.
